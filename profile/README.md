This organization was the previous home of a community-led version of Chris Kempson's [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) project. This organization was originally expected to be the new permanent home for that project, but unfortunately that did not quite go as planned. For the full story please see our post [Base16 Project Lives On (soon to be renamed)](https://github.com/tinted-theming/home/issues/51).

We have rebranded under the name [Tinted Theming](https://github.com/tinted-theming) and will be using that organization moving forward. Keep an eye out for what we're working on! We have plans to clean up what we already have and expand to support more scheme systems!

Also a big thank you to all of you who have been so enthusiastic and involved in the new organization.
