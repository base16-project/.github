We're currently working on changing our name to avoid any confusion with Chris Kempson's [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) project.

This organization was originally expected to be the new permanent home for that project, but unfortunately that did not quite go as planned.

For the full story please see our post [Base16 Project Lives On (soon to be renamed)](https://github.com/base16-project/base16/issues/51k).

Also a big thank you to all of you who have been so enthusiastic and involved in the new organization.
